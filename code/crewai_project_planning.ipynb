      "\n",
      "1. **John Doe (Project Manager)** is assigned to lead the **Requirements Analysis and Planning** task as it requires strong leadership to coordinate stakeholder inputs and align the vision early on, ensuring a clear path for the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Bob Smith (Designer)** is responsible for all design phases and tasks (responsive design, UI design, navigation system design) due to his specialization as a designer. The design phases are given adequate time while allowing sequential work to minimize iterations later on. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Jane Doe (Software Engineer)** is tasked with developing the website's pages (About Us, Services, Contact Us, Blog, Testimonials) as she has the skillset necessary for frontend development. By scheduling these tasks consecutively, she can maintain focus on the development process and leverage any feedback from design directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Alice Johnson (QA Engineer)** is assigned to **Quality Assurance Testing** because she needs to ensure product quality after John and Jane's work is done. Allocating this task ensures that any bugs can be addressed before the integration phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Tom Brown (QA Engineer)** will perform **Load and Performance Testing**, which is crucial after the completion of several development tasks. This timing allows realistic testing scenarios under anticipated load conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Jane Doe (Software Engineer)** will also handle **Social Media Integration** which is a straightforward task that can seamlessly follow her other development activities, minimizing context-switching.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Final Review and Launch** involves both John Doe (PM) for leadership and oversight, and Alice Johnson (QA) to ensure that quality checks are thoroughly completed before going live.\n",
      "\n",
      "This allocation takes into account the team‚Äôs skills, availability, and current workloads while evenly distributing tasks to optimize efficiency and enhance project success. By following this strategic task allocation, we can anticipate timely delivery for each project phase within the overall 15 weeks timeline.\u001b[00m\n",
